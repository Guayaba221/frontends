# Scroll Canvas - Anthropomorphic "assistants" Integration Guide for Developers

## Introduction

This guide provides developers with the necessary steps to integrate the Canvas minting functionality on the Scroll network into third-party platforms. By following this guide, you will enable your users to mint badges directly from your platform.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that your platform is compatible with and connected to the Scroll network. Developers should have a basic understanding of blockchain interactions and contract operations within the Scroll ecosystem.

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Network Connection

Before initiating any minting operations, verify that the platform is connected to the Scroll network.

### Step 2: Compliance with Minting Requirements

Check for compliance with predefined minting rules set by your platform. These rules are defined by partners and should be verified before proceeding.

### Step 3: User Mint Status

Check if user has already minted the badge. [Related doc](https://github.com/scroll-tech/canvas-contracts/blob/master/docs/canvas-interaction-guide.md#how-to-check-if-a-user-has-minted-their-profile-yet)

### Step 4: Mint Prompt

- If the user has not yet minted the badge, display a scrolly animation. - Design example
  ![Canvas on Bridge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b8445f5-8890-453f-b92c-4834dad5846c) - After the user clicks on the mint badge, show a mint pop-up displaying the default badge information.
  [Example code](https://github.com/scroll-tech/frontends/blob/mainnet/src/pages/bridge/components/MintBadge/index.tsx) (The `Canvas` component is the scrolly animation component, and the `BadgeDetailDialog` is the pop-up component.)

- If the badge has already been minted, terminate the process.

### Step 5: Additional Conditions

Check if the user has minted canvas. Based on the minting status:

- If already minted, allow minting of the badge.
  - Design example
    ![BadgeDetailDialog](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a664aa2-9d17-4f38-a170-11bb0f413e20)
- If not minted, disallow and redirect the user to the Scroll canvas mint page.
  - Design example
    ![BadgeDetailDialog without Canvas](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56d92a81-81c8-42fc-98e1-4f6df729bc67)

### Step 6: Execute Mint Operation

- Implement a button that, when clicked, triggers the mint interface. This action calls the mint contract. Scroll supports 3 different types of badges, each with its corresponding minting method. You can refer to [the document](https://github.com/scroll-tech/canvas-contracts/blob/master/docs/badge-examples.md) for details.

### Step 7: Post-Mint Process

After successfully minting, redirect to the userâ€™s badge detail page and display the badge information.

- Design example
  ![BadgeDetailPage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a0d53ae-7a24-4c1c-abdf-d6c7716a2a4c)

This guide should assist you in successfully integrating the Canvas mint functionality within your platform. If you need additional support or have any questions, please contact our developer support team.

## Reference

All the methods used in the frontend

Mint badge pop-up
https://github.com/scroll-tech/frontends/blob/mainnet/src/pages/canvas/Dashboard/BadgeDetailDialog/index.tsx

For third parties, the possible statuses include

```
BadgeDetailDialogType {
 	HIDDEN = "",
 	MINT = "mint",
 	UPGRADE = "upgrade",
 	VIEW = "view",
 	NO_CANVAS = "noCanvas",
 }
```

Note that when a badge has not been minted, it is necessary to set default information and a preview image.
